# Echoes 🎙️

**The world's first audio-first social media platform — built for the blind, loved by everyone.**

This is the v2 clean rebuild: real R2 audio storage, Clerk authentication, and an immersive swipe-navigable feed designed to coexist with — never override — standard screen reader navigation.

---

## What changed from v1

- **Auth**: Clerk (phone/OTP, free to 50,000 monthly active users) replaces the original HMAC token system
- **Audio storage**: real uploads to Cloudflare R2, replacing temporary browser blob URLs that didn't persist
- **Navigation**: a dedicated immersive feed view with swipe-up/down (next/previous), double-tap (like), and long-press (save) gestures — scoped entirely to the feed so it never conflicts with VoiceOver/TalkBack's own swipe-based navigation elsewhere in the app
- **Visual identity**: rebuilt around the trademarked Echoes logo — deep navy base, electric blue gradient accent, geometric display type
- **Creator payments**: a `creator_earnings` table to track and pay standout writers/narrators

Every swipe gesture has an identical, fully focusable button equivalent rendered alongside it — swipe is an accelerator for people who want it, never the only way to do something.

## Getting started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A Cloudflare account
- A Clerk account (clerk.com — free)
- Wrangler CLI: `npm install -g wrangler`

### 2. Install

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up Cloudflare resources

```bash
wrangler login
wrangler d1 create echoes-db        # copy the database_id into wrangler.toml
wrangler r2 bucket create echoes-audio
```

**Make the R2 bucket publicly readable** so audio files can be served directly:
in the Cloudflare dashboard, go to R2 → echoes-audio → Settings → Public Access → enable, and copy the public bucket URL into `wrangler.toml` as `R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`.

Run the migration:
```bash
npm run db:migrate:remote
```

### 4. Set up Clerk

Create an application at clerk.com. Choose phone number (OTP) as your primary sign-in method — no typed passwords, which is the most accessible option for screen reader users.

Copy your **publishable key** into `.env` (see `.env.example`):
```
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxxxxx
```

Copy your **Frontend API URL** into `wrangler.toml`'s `CLERK_JWKS_URL`:
```
CLERK_JWKS_URL = "https://your-app-name.clerk.accounts.dev/.well-known/jwks.json"
```

### 5. Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

1. Push to GitHub
2. Cloudflare Dashboard → Workers & Pages → Create → Pages → Connect to Git
3. Build command: `npm run build`, output directory: `dist`
4. Environment variables: `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, and confirm `CLERK_JWKS_URL` / `R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` are set in `wrangler.toml` or as Pages environment variables
5. Bind your D1 database (`DB`) and R2 bucket (`AUDIO_BUCKET`) under Pages → Settings → Functions
6. Deploy

Every push to `main` redeploys automatically.

## On the swipe gesture design

Swipe navigation is intentionally confined to the immersive feed view, not applied app-wide. Screen readers (VoiceOver, TalkBack) already own swipe gestures system-wide — swipe right/left moves focus between elements, double-tap activates whatever is focused. If Echoes hijacked swipes everywhere, it would fight that model on every screen: settings, profile, comments.

Inside the feed, there's exactly one piece of content active at a time, so a custom swipe language can layer on top of, rather than compete with, standard screen reader behavior. And critically: every swipe action (next, previous, like, save, share) has an identical button alongside it with a proper `aria-label`. Nobody is ever required to use swipe to get something done.
